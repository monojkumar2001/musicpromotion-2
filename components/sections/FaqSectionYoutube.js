						<p className="accordion-body">
						We are going to use our own partner networks (music promoters, music curator blogs , online radio stations, playlists, and others) to promote your Youtube music organically. We are partnered with thousands of independent playlist curators all over the world. We also run native ad campaigns on popular social media channels & search engines to get an initial traction and boost engagement. Our marketing method combines these two different approaches (For the Premium Plan): 1- We run native ad campaigns across different websites and blogs related to your music genre. 2- We also send your music and artist channel to hundreds of playlist curators and influencers (the actual number varies based on genre and target country), so they can promote your tracks. They might choose to promote your tracks or not, based on their own preference. Only for Premium Plans With both strategies, you'll get fully REAL and TARGETED engagements. We don't ever send bots or any type of fake engagements. Our services fully comply with Youtube's terms of service.
