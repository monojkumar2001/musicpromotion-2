                suppliers, service providers or licensors shall not be liable
                for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect,
                incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any
                kind, including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue,
                lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any other
                similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including
                negligence), strict liability, or for any other claim related in
                any way to your use of the service or any product, including but
                not limited to any errors or omissions in any content, or any
                loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of
                the service or any content (or product) posted, transmitted, or
                otherwise made available via the service, even if the provider
                of the service has been informed of the possibility of such
                damages. In states or jurisdictions where such exclusion or
                limitation of responsibility for consequential or incidental
                damages is not permitted, our liability shall be restricted to
                the greatest extent permissible by law.
