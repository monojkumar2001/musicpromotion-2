										What is Medical Cannabis Sativa?
									</h2>
									<p>
										Medical Cannabis sativa, also known as medical marijuana,
										uses extracts from the marijuana plant to treat and manage
										diseases and other ill-health conditions.
									</p>
									<p>
										It is a medical field that basically involves some of the
										products used in recreational marijuana but for medical
										purposes instead.
									</p>
									<p>
										Medical marijuana products contain over 100 different
										chemicals known as cannabinoids. It is also important to
										note that most medical marijuana products contain low
										amounts of THC which is a compound known for creating the
										high you get when you use marijuana.
									</p>
									<p>
										The cannabinoids contained in medical cannabis sativa have
										many health benefits, especially in the management of
										stressful and painful conditions.
